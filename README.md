# survfit.coxme
Headed into the weeds to attempt a survfit method for coxme

Instead of writing a full-fledged method that is highly generalizable, I 
went ahead and wrote some functions that would get the job done for me.

They can be run with

`devtools::source_gist("c351c84ee9fca9888c57")`

**BUT**, this is a very touchy set of functions.
